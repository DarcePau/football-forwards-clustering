# football-forwards-clustering
Repository with data and code that implements a k-means clustering of football forwards in the big 5 European leagues.

## Introduction
This repository contains data from the FBref website (https://fbref.com/en/) relating to shooting, passsing, pass types and goal and shot creation for the big 5 European Leagues in CSV format. Alongside that there is also a Google Colaboratory notebook implementing a K-means algorithm for stylistic classification and subsetting of forwards in the big 5 European leagues. The insights achieved through that notebook were reported within the final project paper of the Machine Learning for Biomedicine course taught at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona during the spring term of 2021. Said paper was coauthored by Francesc Carandell Verdaguer and Pau Altur Pastor, 3rd year undergraduate students of the Biomedical Engineering degree at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
